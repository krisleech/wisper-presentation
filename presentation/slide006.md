        SUMMARY

        • Nicely encapsulate non-core concerns, such as updating the UI via websockets
        • Keep domain objects free from unrelated side effects
        • Smaller objects with fewer responsibilities
        • Objects can be wired up based on context in a lightweight manner
        • Objects tell listeners what happened, not what to do (trusting, not controlling)
        • Clear boundaries exist between objects in different layers.
