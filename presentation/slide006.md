        SUMMARY

        • Smaller objects with fewer responsibilities
        • Listeners group similar often changing behaviours
        • Better encapsulation of responsibilities
        • Domain objects focus on state and behaviour (easier to split domain and persistence)
        • Objects can be wired up based on context in a lightweight manner
        • Objects tell listeners what happened, not what to do (trusting, not controlling)
        • Clear boundaries exist between objects in different layers
